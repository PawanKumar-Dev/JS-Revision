// In JS there are 3 ways to declare variables.

const accountId = 458079

let userName = "Pawan"

var emaiID = "pawan@gmail.com"


// Usage of "var" keyword is not encourged since it has functional scope(if inside a function) but if outside a function then it has global scope.

// "let" and "const" are modern way to declare variables. They have a block scope.


isPresent = true

// When we don't have an explicit declaration, then "var" keyword is used by default. So avoid such declaration.
