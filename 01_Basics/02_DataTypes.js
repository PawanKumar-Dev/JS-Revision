/*
Acc. to offical documentation all datatypes in JS can divided into 2 types based on how data is stored and retrived from computer memory:
    1. Primitive (String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt)
    2. Non-Primitive (Array, Object, Function)
*/

// Primitive datatypes are stored and retrived from "Stack" memory. Hence refered as "call by value" datatypes. Becoz when we retrive them, we get copy of original value.
