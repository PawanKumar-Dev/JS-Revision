// Control flow means whether our code is excuted is conditional or not. For this we use if-else. Our code get excuted only if() condition is true.
// Conditions are evaluted by comparison operators like: <, >, >=, <=, ==, ===
// Remember single (equalto =) is assignment operator.
const userLoggedIn = true

if(userLoggedIn) {
    console.log("Execute")
}

// Similarly you can a condition for evalution
if(2 === "2") {
    console.log("Condition is true")
} else {
    console.log("Condition is false")
