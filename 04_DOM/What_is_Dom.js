// The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects.
// This allows JS to interact and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a webpage dynamically.

// DOM (Document Object Model) is like a bridge between your web page and JavaScript.
// It turns your HTML into an object that JavaScript can work with.
