// reduce(), map(), forEach() are these methods or loops in JS?
// It can confusing since they are looping through our data like "for loop"

// Answer: reduce(), map(), and forEach() are built-in array methods in JS. They are not control flow constructs like traditional "for" or "while" loops.
// Using these methods tends to be more "declarative".
// You describe what you want to achieve (e.g., transformation in map(), accumulation in reduce()) rather than how to iterate through array.
// So they produce cleaner, more readable code.
// For e.g., there's no need to manually manage an index or loop counter.
